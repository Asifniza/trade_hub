        Our tradehub website is a place where people can buy and sell things
        safely and fairly. We expect everyone to be nice to each other and
        follow the rules. When you list something to sell, make sure you
        describe it accurately and don't sell anything illegal. If you have a
        problem with a transaction, we'll help you solve it. We want everyone to
        feel welcome and respected here, so please be kind and report any bad
        behavior. Your privacy and security are important to us, and we'll
        protect your information. If you see something that doesn't seem right,
        let us know, and we'll fix it. By using our website, you agree to play
        by these rules and help us make it better for everyone.
